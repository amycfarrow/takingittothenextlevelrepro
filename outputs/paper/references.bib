The concept of person-environment fit and how it influences performance have received increasing interest in the education field. In this study, a teacher’s values orientation represents the environment and, therefore, we employed a dyadic fit relationship approach to examine whether the congruence of student-teacher values influences students’ learning performance.
. The research data were retrieved from a large database, the Taiwan Education Panel Survey. A dyadic profile similarity index method was conducted to measure student-teacher congruence.
. The results indicate that (a) students and teachers share a common education values structure; and (b) the values congruence between students and their teachers may influence students’ learning performance.
. The research findings imply that similarities in values between students and teachers could affect student learning. However, intrinsic education values fit and extrinsic education values fit seems to function differently in this relationship.}, number={5}, journal={Social science quarterly}, publisher={Wiley Variant}, author={Tzu-Ling Lai}, year={2015}, pages={1424–1435} }

In the first randomized field experiment that leverages actual similarities to improve real-world relationships, we examined the affiliations between 315 ninth grade students and their 25 teachers. Students in the treatment condition received feedback on five similarities that they shared with their teachers; each teacher received parallel feedback regarding about half of his/her ninth grade students. Five weeks after our intervention, those in the treatment conditions perceived greater similarity with their counterparts. Furthermore, when teachers received feedback about their similarities with specific students, they perceived better relationships with those students, and those students earned higher course grades. Exploratory analyses suggest that these effects are concentrated within relationships between teachers and their “underserved” students. This brief intervention appears to close the achievement gap at this
school by over 60%.}, publisher={American Psychological Association}, author={Gehlbach, Hunter and Brinkworth, Maureen Elizabeth and King, Aaron and Hsu, Laura and McIntyre, Joe and Rogers, Todd T.}, year={2015} }

Although teacher–student relationships lie at the heart of students’ schooling experience, fundamental questions regarding these relationships remain unanswered.
Aims. This study investigates three related questions about these relationships: To what extent do they change from the beginning to the end of a school year? Are any emergent changes associated with shifts in students’ academic or motivational outcomes? Are certain ‘upstream’ factors associated with improvements or declines in teacher–student relationships?
Sample. We investigate these questions with a sample of middle school students (N = 119) and their teachers (N = 30).
Methods. Through a novel approach which accounts for both perspectives within teacher–student relationships, we assess these relationships at the beginning and end of the school year. Using multi‐level models, we examine how changes in these relationships are associated with changes in students’ grades, homework completion rates, self‐efficacy, and effort. In addition, we examine associations with two potential precursors to teacher–student relationships: students’ accuracy in taking their teachers’ perspective and their perceptions of similarity to their teachers.
Results. We find that substantial changes occur in these relationships from the beginning to the end of the year; these changes are associated with shifts in important student outcomes; and changes in students’ social perspective taking accuracy and perceived similarity to their teachers correspond with changes in teacher–student relationships.
Conclusions. Given the malleability of teacher–student relationships and their importance for key achievement and motivational outcomes, we advocate for researchers to conduct field experiments to inform how to improve these critical relationships.}, number={4}, journal={British journal of educational psychology}, publisher={Blackwell Publishing Ltd}, author={Gehlbach, Hunter and Brinkworth, Maureen E. and Harris, Anna D.}, year={2012}, pages={690–704} }

Using a free-range dyad harvest method, we collected 11 independent samples with 1,523 interacting pairs, and compared dyad members’ personality traits, attitudes, values, recreational activities, and alcohol and drug use. Within-dyad similarity was statistically significant on 86% of variables measured. To determine whether similarity was primarily attributable to niche construction (i.e., selection) or social influence, we tested whether similarity increased as closeness, intimacy, discussion, length of relationship, and importance of the attitude increased. There were no effects on similarity of closeness, relationship length, or discussion of the attitude. There were quite modest effects of intimacy, and a reliable effect of the shared importance of the attitude. Because relationship length, intimacy, closeness, and discussion can all serve as markers of opportunity for, or potency of social influence, these data are consistent with the “niche construction” account of similarity. In 2 follow-up controlled longitudinal field studies, participants interacted with people they did not know from their large lecture classes, and at a later time completed a survey of attitudes, values, and personality traits. Interacting pairs were not more similar than chance, but for the 23% of dyads that interacted beyond the first meeting, there was significant similarity within dyad members. These 2 lines of inquiry converge to suggest that similarity is mainly due to niche construction, and is most important in the early stages of a relationship; its importance to further relationship development wanes.}, number={2}, journal={Journal of personality and social psychology}, publisher={American Psychological Association}, author={Bahns, Angela J. and Crandall, Christian S. and Gillath, Omri and Preacher, Kristopher J.}, year={2017}, pages={329–355} }

A time-lagged study with a total of 99 newcomers and their mentors was conducted within three months of newcomers entering the company. The results support our hypotheses, suggesting that perceived deep similarity is a key factor that associates with the effectiveness of newcomers’ proactivity and mentors’ information sharing behavior in newcomer adjustment.

These challenges implicate how school leaders understand the connections between TSRs and student outcomes. This article addresses these challenges by describing a new approach to measuring TSRs centered around a new scale that measures the positive and negative aspects of the overall TSR from teachers’ and students’ perspectives. We describe the scale development process, document the measure’s psychometric properties, and then use the scale to predict student outcomes. Drawing from a sample of middle and high school students (N=595) and their teachers (N=88) in four different schools, we found that a two-factor model best fits our items. Compared to a more traditional approach, our approach explains more variability in student outcomes and gives educators a sharper understanding of the patterning of associations between TSRs and student outcomes.

Results were based on 99 studies, including students from preschool to high school. Separate analyses were conducted for positive relationships and engagement (k = 61 studies, N = 88,417 students), negative relationships and engagement (k = 18, N = 5,847), positive relationships and achievement (k = 61, N = 52,718), and negative relationships and achievement (k = 28, N = 18,944). Overall, associations of both positive and negative relationships with engagement were medium to large, whereas associations with achievement were small to medium. Some of these associations were weaker, but still statistically significant, after correction for methodological biases. Overall, stronger effects were found in the higher grades. Nevertheless, the effects of negative relationships were stronger in primary than in secondary school. © 2011 AERA.

It was predicted that positive student-instructor relationships would mediate associations between student attachment stances, instructor classroom behaviors and achievement orientations. To test this prediction, college students (N = 263) completed measures assessing achievement orientations, attachment stances, instructor relationship, and instructor-related behaviors in a randomly determined class. Instructor immediacy was significantly related to student achievement orientations; however, this association was partially mediated by student-instructor relationship quality. Highly immediate instructors had students who reported positive relationships with them, and this stance was associated with proficient achievement orientations. Student attachment stances were largely unrelated to relationships with instructors and achievement orientations. Implications for research and practice are offered.
