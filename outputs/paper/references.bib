The concept of person-environment fit and how it influences performance have received increasing interest in the education field. In this study, a teacher’s values orientation represents the environment and, therefore, we employed a dyadic fit relationship approach to examine whether the congruence of student-teacher values influences students’ learning performance.
. The research data were retrieved from a large database, the Taiwan Education Panel Survey. A dyadic profile similarity index method was conducted to measure student-teacher congruence.
. The results indicate that (a) students and teachers share a common education values structure; and (b) the values congruence between students and their teachers may influence students’ learning performance.
. The research findings imply that similarities in values between students and teachers could affect student learning. However, intrinsic education values fit and extrinsic education values fit seems to function differently in this relationship.}, number={5}, journal={Social science quarterly}, publisher={Wiley Variant}, author={Tzu-Ling Lai}, year={2015}, pages={1424–1435} }

College students (
N
= 349) enrolled in 22 classes first rated instructor effectiveness on a 28-item rating form and then rated their own attitudes plus instructor attitudes on an attitude scale adapted from
Byrne (1971)
. Another 296 college students enrolled in 19 classes rated instructor effectiveness and then their own attitudes plus instructor attitudes on an attitude scale adapted from
Hofman and Kremer (1980)
. For both student groups, official end-of-term grades were also collected. Consistent with prior research, modest correlations (
p
< .05) were found between student ratings and perceived attitude similarity (mean
r
= −.23). There was also a modest relation (
p
< .05) between similarity and course grades (mean
r
= −.20). These relations were greatly reduced (56.2% and 44.5%, respectively) when the large influence of instructors on ratings and achievement was removed. The findings fail to support the claim that perceived attitude similarity is a substantial source of bias in student ratings.}, number={6}, journal={Journal of educational psychology}, publisher={American Psychological Association}, author={Abrami, Philip C. and Mizener, Deborah A.}, year={1985}, pages={693–702} }

In the first randomized field experiment that leverages actual similarities to improve real-world relationships, we examined the affiliations between 315 ninth grade students and their 25 teachers. Students in the treatment condition received feedback on five similarities that they shared with their teachers; each teacher received parallel feedback regarding about half of his/her ninth grade students. Five weeks after our intervention, those in the treatment conditions perceived greater similarity with their counterparts. Furthermore, when teachers received feedback about their similarities with specific students, they perceived better relationships with those students, and those students earned higher course grades. Exploratory analyses suggest that these effects are concentrated within relationships between teachers and their “underserved” students. This brief intervention appears to close the achievement gap at this
school by over 60%.}, publisher={American Psychological Association}, author={Gehlbach, Hunter and Brinkworth, Maureen Elizabeth and King, Aaron and Hsu, Laura and McIntyre, Joe and Rogers, Todd T.}, year={2015} }

 @article{Gehlbach_Brinkworth_Harris_2012, place={Oxford, UK}, title={Changes in teacher–student relationships}, volume={82}, ISSN={0007-0998}, DOI={10.1111/j.2044-8279.2011.02058.x}, abstractNote={Background. Although teacher–student relationships lie at the heart of students’ schooling experience, fundamental questions regarding these relationships remain unanswered.
Aims. This study investigates three related questions about these relationships: To what extent do they change from the beginning to the end of a school year? Are any emergent changes associated with shifts in students’ academic or motivational outcomes? Are certain ‘upstream’ factors associated with improvements or declines in teacher–student relationships?
Sample. We investigate these questions with a sample of middle school students (N = 119) and their teachers (N = 30).
Methods. Through a novel approach which accounts for both perspectives within teacher–student relationships, we assess these relationships at the beginning and end of the school year. Using multi‐level models, we examine how changes in these relationships are associated with changes in students’ grades, homework completion rates, self‐efficacy, and effort. In addition, we examine associations with two potential precursors to teacher–student relationships: students’ accuracy in taking their teachers’ perspective and their perceptions of similarity to their teachers.
Results. We find that substantial changes occur in these relationships from the beginning to the end of the year; these changes are associated with shifts in important student outcomes; and changes in students’ social perspective taking accuracy and perceived similarity to their teachers correspond with changes in teacher–student relationships.
Conclusions. Given the malleability of teacher–student relationships and their importance for key achievement and motivational outcomes, we advocate for researchers to conduct field experiments to inform how to improve these critical relationships.}, number={4}, journal={British journal of educational psychology}, publisher={Blackwell Publishing Ltd}, author={Gehlbach, Hunter and Brinkworth, Maureen E. and Harris, Anna D.}, year={2012}, pages={690–704} }
